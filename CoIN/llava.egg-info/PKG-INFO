## Abstract
Instruction tuning represents a prevalent strategy employed by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align with human instructions and adapt to new tasks. Nevertheless, MLLMs encounter the challenge of adapting to users' evolving knowledge and demands. Therefore, how to retain existing skills while acquiring new knowledge needs to be investigated. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark, namely ContinuaL Instruction tuNing (CoIN), to assess existing MLLMs in sequential instruction tuning paradigm. CoIN comprises 10 commonly used datasets spanning 8 task categories, ensuring a diverse range of instructions and tasks. Besides, the trained model is evaluated from two aspects: Instruction Following and General Knowledge, which assess the alignment with human intention and knowledge preserved for reasoning, respectively. Experiments on CoIN demonstrate that current powerful MLLMs still suffer catastrophic forgetting, and the failure in intention alignment assumes the main responsibility, instead of the knowledge forgetting. To this end, we introduce MoELoRA to MLLMs which is effective to retain the previous instruction alignment. Experimental results consistently illustrate the forgetting decreased from this method on CoIN.

## Install
1. Clone this repository and navigate to CoIN folder

## Dataset
Please download the images from the constituting dataset: ScienceQA, VQAv2, VizWiz, TextVQA, GQA, OCR-VQA, ImageNet, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg.

After downloading all of them, organize the data as follows:
```
├── COCO2014
│   └── train2014
├── GQA
│   └── images
├── OCR-VQA
│   └── images
├── TextVQA
│   └── train_images
│   └── test_images
```

Then, please download the instructions from our datasets path: [CoIN_Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zacks-Chen/CoIN/tree/main)
then, organize the instructions as follows:
```
├── Instruction_Type1
│   └── GQA
│       └── train.json
│       └── test.json
│   └── ScienceQA
│       └── train.json
│       └── test.json
├── Instruction_Type2
│   └── GQA
│       └── train.json
│       └── test.json
```

## Instruction Tuning
First, downloading the pretrained projectors in [LLaVA Model_Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md).

Setting `pretrain_mm_mlp_adapter` to the projector path.
You could modify the `deepspeed config` to change the deepspeed config.

We provide the scripts of our train order in `scripts/CoIN/Train`.
Note, the `output_dir` of the previous script is the `previous_task_model_path` of the next training process.
Then, you could tune these datasets in your order.

### MoELoRA
For training with MoeLoRA, you could train scripts in `scripts/CoIN/Train_MOE`.

## Evaluation
We have prepared the scripts to evaluate the trained model in `scripts/CoIN/Eval`.

These scripts will evalute the trained model and create the prompts (`prompt_to_eval.json`) for evaluating the general knowldege.

To evaluate the general knowldege, you could add the result path to `llava/eval/CoIN/to_eval_prompt.txt` and run the `llava/eval/CoIN/evaluate_generalknowledege.py`, this python file will output a score to indicate the general knowledge.

## To Do
1. - [] Evaluating on more MLLM, MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-V2, InstrctBlip, Qwen-VL;
2. - [] Evaluating on different size of MLLM;
3. - [] Evaluating on full finetune.
